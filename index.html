              different transmission paths and through multiple compression stages for storage and processing. Thanks
              very much for this unique and useful service.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">I wanted to let you know that during this lockdown time my family has used your random card
              sorter to play long distance card games over Zoom. My parents (in their 80's located in Oregon) and their
              two daughters (Alaska and Arizona) are able to meet weekly and play a few hands of Hearts. Without your
              website it would not have been possible. My parents look forward to our weekly time and we will likely
              continue even past the virus protection time. I know there are online games that could work for the card
              purpose, but the ability to see each other's faces is more important than the cards. My parents are not
              tech savvy and would not be able to participate in anything online. So we have settled on this method of
              playing long distance cards.

              Suggestion: If I had a wish however, I would wish that the output of the random cards were in rows of 13
              (as if they were dealt to 4 people). It would make it so much easier to forward everyone's cards. :-)

              Thank you!</p>
